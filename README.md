# Booking-System
## Overview
A web-based appointment scheduling system designed for a salon, integrating Google Calendar for real-time booking management. This project showcases my ability to build functional front-end interfaces, work with APIs, and tackle back-end challenges.

## Features
- **Practitioner Selection**: Users choose from hairdressers, aestheticians, or nail technicians.
- **Service Booking**: Select from predefined appointment types (e.g., Haircut, Gel Manicure) with varying durations.
- **Calendar & Time Slots**: Interactive calendar displays available slots, updated dynamically via Google Calendar API.
- **Booking Confirmation**: Users input details and receive a unique code for cancellations.
- **Cancellation Page**: Allows appointment removal using the booking code.
- **Notifications**: Employees receive Google Calendar alerts for scheduled appointments.

## Tech Stack
- **Front-End**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **API**: Google Calendar API for event management
- **Back-End**: Basic server interaction (assumed Node.js/Express, hosted locally)

## Key Learnings
- Mastered asynchronous JavaScript (e.g., fetch, async/await) for API calls.
- Designed a multi-step user flow with dynamic DOM manipulation.
- Navigated back-end integration challenges using online resources (e.g., Stack Overflow).

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Back-End Gap**: Limited prior experience; relied on trial-and-error and documentation to connect front-end to Google Calendar.
- **Time Slot Logic**: Built a custom algorithm to calculate availability based on appointment duration and existing bookings.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance error handling with user-friendly messages.
- Add input validation for forms.
- Optimize global variable management with a modular structure.

## Purpose
This repository demonstrates my coding skills and problem-solving ability to potential employers. Itâ€™s a personal project reflecting my growth in web development.
